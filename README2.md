# Difference Between JAR and WAR Files

### 1. **JAR (Java ARchive)**
   - A **JAR** file is a packaged archive that contains Java classes, libraries, and resources, such as images or configuration files.
   - It is primarily used for **Java libraries or standalone applications** that can run independently.

#### Key Characteristics:
   - **Executable JARs**: Can be executed as a standalone application if the `main` method is included.
   - **No Web Container**: Doesn't need a web server or servlet container.
   - Typically used for **non-web applications** (e.g., desktop applications, utility tools).
   
#### Example:
   - **`your-app.jar`**: This is a JAR file that you can run using `java -jar your-app.jar`.

### 2. **WAR (Web Application ARchive)**
   - A **WAR** file is a special type of JAR file designed to package web applications for deployment on a **web server** or **application server** (e.g., Tomcat, Jetty).
   - It includes everything needed for the web application, such as servlets, JSPs, and static resources.

#### Key Characteristics:
   - **Requires a Web Server**: A WAR file needs a servlet container (like Tomcat) to run.
   - **Contains Web Resources**: Can include **HTML**, **CSS**, **JS**, **JSPs**, and **servlets** for the web layer.
   - Typically used for **web applications**.

#### Example:
   - **`your-app.war`**: This is a WAR file that needs to be deployed on a server like Tomcat for execution.

### Key Differences:
| Feature                        | **JAR**                           | **WAR**                                |
|---------------------------------|-----------------------------------|----------------------------------------|
| **Purpose**                     | For Java libraries and standalone applications | For web applications, to be deployed on a web server |
| **Executable**                  | Can be executed directly (if itâ€™s an executable JAR) | Needs a web server (e.g., Tomcat) to run |
| **Structure**                    | Contains Java classes, libraries, and resources | Contains web-related files, servlets, JSPs, HTML, CSS, JS |
| **Server Dependency**           | No need for a server | Requires a servlet container (e.g., Tomcat) |
| **Usage**                       | Desktop apps, utilities, backend services | Web applications, APIs |

### Conclusion:
- **JAR** is used for general Java applications or libraries, while **WAR** is specifically used for deploying web applications on a server.
